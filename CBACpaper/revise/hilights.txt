The method developed here provides a fast and flexible way to capture the
structure of most macromolecules in a hierarchy of increasingly larger coarse-grained
levels without losing the detailed low-level representation.   Although much testing
remains to be done, the system has the potential to be applied to very large dynamic
systems including both protein and nucleic acids.
