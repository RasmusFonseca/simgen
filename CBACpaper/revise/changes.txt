> 
> For basepairs, if these are part of a double helix, their 'bond-length' is the distance
> between their mid-points (object centre) which is refined to an ideal base-stacking separation.  
> Outside a base-pair, say in a loop region, the 'secondary structure', like a loop in a protein,
> can contain multiple nucleotides and no bond length is refined.
> 
> At the domain level, double-stranded DNA segments will always be bonded end-to-end
> at a specific distance that allows the helix to run continuously from one segment to
> the next.   On the other hand, when the segment is an RNA stem-loop, the chain can enter
> and exit the same end of the tube or, with an insertion, even through the side.
