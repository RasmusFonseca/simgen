Dear Jaap,

The referee is correct in pointing out that the coverage of the literature is 
indeed rather thin.   I have rectified this by adding the following references
to the revised paper, not just in the section titled "Relationship to other
methods", but also, where relevant to the Introduction section also.

The new citations follow with an indication of the section in which they first
occur.  As the paper is now in the Elsiever LaTeX format, it is not possible to
make a full "diff" of the changes so instead I have included the changed lines
containing the citation.

I hope this addresses the referees concern.

With best wishes, Willie

\subsection{Relationship to other methods}
As outlined in the Introduction, the current method lies somewhere between a
hierarchical bounding box approach \cite{TeschnerMet05} and the neighbour-list
approaches more commonly found in conventional molecular dynamics.   Although improvements
have been made since their original implementation \cite{VerletL67}, such as the cell-based
algorithm \cite{YaoZet04},  the neighbour-list approach requires the lists to be updated frequently
which involves considerable "book-keeping", especially for objects of different shapes
and sizes \cite{DonevAet05,MuthBet07}.   By contrast in the current method, the
neighbour-list is a fixed hierarchy in which the lower levels are only evaluated
when higher levels collide.

or perhaps exploiting the hierarchic organisation along the lines of Gipson {\em et al.} \cite{GipsonBet13}.
A second path to resolve the problem might be through a variation of Gaussian elastic
networks \cite{ZhangZet09}.  However, elastic...
