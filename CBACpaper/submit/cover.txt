Dear Jaap, Jeffry and Wentian,

I have submitted a paper to your journal that describes a development of
my coarse-grained molecular simulation program, including some example
applications that I hope are of interest.

The current work is a generalisation of an approach previously published
in your journal and I hope the current work will provide the definitive
description and be the primary citation for all later applications.

With best wishes,
Willie
