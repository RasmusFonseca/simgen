\subsection{Summary}

\subsubsection{Collision algorithms}

The algorithms described in this work for the interaction of a hierarchy of objects
seek to circumvent a fundamental problem in coarse-grained modelling which
is the loss of fine detail when components become 'bundled' together.
The "currants-in-jelly" model developed here provides a flexible approach in which
the contribution of the soft high-level objects (jelly-like) can be controlled
to protect the underlying atomic structure (currants) while still allowing
them to interact.

Idealised macromolecular chains were used to establish the parameters
to achieve this degree of interaction over a hierarchy spanning four levels.
In a more realistic example using a small globular protein, the extent of the 
distortion experienced by the protein domain structure during collision was then 
examined and the parameters refined to allow an acceptable degree of deformation.

\subsubsection{Constraint satisfaction}

The model of steric repulsion established for idealised systems was then
combined with sets of predicted distance constraints, derived from correlated
mutation analysis,  in two differing applications.    Firstly, an integral
trans-membrane protein was modelled in which the packing of the seven
helices was refined but without topological rearrangement.  Secondly,
an RNA structure was 'folded' under the predicted constraints, starting only
from its 2-dimensional secondary structure prediction.

From the large sequence alignment available for the membrane protein, high
quality distance predictions could be obtained, which combined with good
starting configurations (provided by a simplified lattice model) led to 
the production of high-scoring models with a low RMSD to the known structure.
By contrast, the RNA structure predictions had high RMSD values and although
the stem-loops were correctly located in the highier-scoring models, topological
differences remained which may be a result of constraints imposed by the
flat starting conformation.

\subsection{Limitations and potential}

Whilst the methods and parameters established here have been shown to be
effective, it is unlikely that they are optimal and many aspects of the
model remain to be explored.    The approach taken above was to pick
'reasonable' values for the extent and strength of an interaction and test
a few variations and combinations in the surrounding parameter-space.
A more systematic approach is needed, and for this the speed of the current
method is a great advantage as many simulations can be run, allowing the
parameter space to be more fully explored and optimal combinations found
for different types of macromolecule.

An earlier, simpler, version of the current method was used to model the
dynamic interaction of actin and myosin.   However, because the atomic (residue)
surfaces did not interact directly in that model, artificial constraints had
to be added to drive the molecular recognition events.  In the current
method, the residue-level surfaces can now come in contact allowing a more
realistic representation of molecular recognition based on steric compatibility.
However, without a proper atomic interaction potential the recognition of 
a binding event would rely on external knowledge of the residues involved.

It was assumed that the parameters used at the start of the simulation remain
the same throughout and equal for all components independently of their
position or interactions.   However, all these aspects could be varied and
if there is a pair of objects that interact preferentially, their parameters
can be set to allow their surfaces to meet whereas others might present a
hard-shell repulsion.  For example, in the actin/myosin example mentioned
above, the actin monomers close to the myosin head could allow atomic
interactions whereas all other interactions retain a high-level repulsion.

The effectiveness of the approach relies on having a rich multi-layer
hierarchy of substructures.   Fortunately, as seen from the varied examples
provided, this is the prevelant situation for the majority of biological
macromolecules.   In the simulation of more homogeneous materials, such
as water, it is unlikely that the approach would be useful.  Similarly, for
a long chain, such as DNA, although segments can be grouped like a string
of sausages, the interaction of two such chains would require evaluation
of the all pairs of sausages.

In large molecules, expecially those composed of subunits, the components may not
remain the same throughout a simulation and during an interaction, one subunit may
need to transfer to another assembly or a large multi-domain chain may be cleaved.
In its current formulation, the program does not accommodate this, however, such
events could easily be incorporated simply by updating the list of children held
by each object or adding new children to the list. 

\subsection{Conclusion}

The method developed here provides a fast and flexible way to capture the
structure of most macromolecules in a hierarchy of increasingly larger coarse-grained
levels without losing the detailed low-level representation.   Although much testing
remains to be done, the system has the potential to be applied to very large dynamic
systems including both protein and nucleic acids.
