\subsection{Collision detection test data}

\subsubsection{Colliding Hilbert chains}

For test data,
a general model of a simple macromolecule was based on a linear chain of atoms.
This chain was then 'packaged' into a hierarchy of spherical objects, each of which contained
eight children arranged as a cube.   To maintain equal bond-lengths between the atoms, the path of the
chain followed a recursive Hilbert curve, in which each level of the hierarchy is identical\footnote{
A Hilbert curve ({\tt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert\_curve}) is the spatial equivalent of a 
Gray code ({\tt https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray\_code}) in which successive elements are
only one step away from their neighbours.
}.   This arrangement generates a homogeneously packed chain which allows the effects of
collisions to be monitored without the added complication of variable internal structure and density.

Collisions between these objects were then engineered by applying an external
motion to propel two identical objects into each other.   To avoid a direct "head-on"
collision, the objects were displaced by half their radius from their line of approach.
As the chain forms a cube, this means that the collision surface encompasses half a face of each cube.
During the collision, the number of bumping atoms was monitored between the two objects
and also within each object.

\paragraph{8+8 crash:\\}

To investigate the the contribution of the soft repulsion component of higher level objects,
the first construct of interest involves the collision of two cubes of eight atoms.  The
repulsion strength at both levels was set to a value of 1 for both hard and soft modes
(although the atomic level only has hard repulsion).   With these values, the containing
spherical shells repelled each other before the atoms could make contact.

The $soft$ parameter value was then decreased, allowing inter-penetration of the high
level spheres,  until the internal atoms made contact.   This occurred when $soft = hard/5$
but most of the displacement still derived from the high-level soft repulsion component
and the internal arrangement of the atoms was almost unchanged.   With no soft repulsion,
the atomic configuration was markedly displaced and as a compromise, $soft = hard/10$
was taken as a combination that allowed a roughly equal contribution from each level.

\paragraph{64+64 crash:\\}

The next level of model considered was the 64 atom chain (Figure 1(a)) and keeping the values established
above for the first level in the hierarchy, an equivalent evaluation was made for the second level.
As with the smaller test object, the first level spheres initially made contact when $soft = hard/5$,
however, because of the added buffering effect of the first-level spheres, the atoms remained
well separated between the two colliding objects even when $soft = hard/10$.  To compensate for
this additive contribution, the $hard$ parameter value on both levels was halved and the 10\%
ratio to the $soft$ parameter retained giving $hard = 0.5, soft = 0.05$.  
(Or 50:5, as a percentage of the atomic value).

with the virtual spheres and atoms now coloured by their collision state: dark-blue designates no
clash while cyan to green to yellow colours are associated with collisions of increasingly distant
relatives.  Cyan = same parent (cousins), green = second cousins, yellow = third. $c$) The number
of levels is increased to four but with smaller atoms and the virtual spheres not rendered to allow
the distribution of clashes to be visualised at the atomic level.  The colliding bodies remain distinct
with only occasional flashes of red (fourth cousins) indicating clashes between atoms in the collision
interface (which runs bottom left to top right).   The distortion of the structures has been 
distributed evenly through many localized (green) interactions.
\end{footnotesize}
}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{512+512 crash:\\}

The evaluation protocol was extended to the 3-level hierarchy of 512 atoms per chain (Figure 1(b)).
Transferring the values from the previous test again led to a lack of direct contact at the
atomic level and these were reduced to $hard = 0.2$, keeping the $soft = hard/10$ ratio.
This produced a result at the mid-point of the collision (when the centroids of the bodies
draw level on their collision course) that was comparable to the smaller systems.

\paragraph{4096+4096 crash:\\}

For the largest model tested, with the chain packaged into 4 levels of containers,  the
progression of reducing the values of the $hard$ and $soft$ parameters was continued.
However, this led to a marked number (100s) of steric violations at the atomic level both
between and within the colliding bodies.   Keeping the two parameters at their previous
levels ($hard = 0.2$, $soft = 0.02$) the number of clashes between the bodies decreased
(10s) but the number of internal violations remained high.   This can be seen in Figure 1(c)
as green coloured atoms and indicates that the distortions produced by the collision are
being distributed through the objects rather than concentrated at the collision interface.

As this model extends beyond the normal size range of compact biological molecules,
no further experimentation was made.   Of greater interest is the degree of distortion 
observed in the "crumple-zone" and to investigate this a more realistic protein model
was used.


\subsubsection{Colliding multiple protein domains}

Progressing to a more biologically realistic system and also to introduce a variety
of container shapes, the small chemotaxis-Y protein (PDB code: {\tt 3chy}), was used
and modelled with tubes to contain its secondary structure elements and an ellipsoid
to contain the protein.    The structure was also stabilised with 'hydrogen-bond'-like
links between the $i..i+3$ and $i..i+4$ positions in the \AHs\ and links between
hydrogen-bonded positions in the \BS. (Figure 2(a)).

A series of multi-domain models were then constructed with the protein chain as a
node on a Hilbert curve giving models of 1, 8 and 64 domains.   The link between 
domains was also optionally broken, making the domains equivalent to subunits.
Collisions between these constructs was engineered as above with the coordinates
being saved at the start of the run and at the end, after the structures were well
past each other.    To monitor the distortion experienced by the domains/subunits
during the collision, each domain in the starting structure was compared to each
domain in the final structure and the smallest, mean and largest root-mean-square
deviation (RMSD) recorded. 

\paragraph{Single domain collision:\\}

Two single domain structures were collided using the same parameters as determined
for the equivalent sized "cubic" chains of the previous subsection ($hard = 1.0$, $soft = 0.1$).
Comparing combinations of the two starting and two final structures, the mean RMS
deviation was 3.6\AA , which is not far in excess of the 2.4\AA\ mean deviation seen
when the two structures travel the same distance but do not collide.   For a protein
of this size, with any RMSD under 5\AA, the structures retain a clear correspondence. 

Increasing the $soft$ parameter to 0.2 led to less distortion (mean RMSD = 3.1) which
is closer to the un-collided value.   While, retaining the same $hard:soft$ ratio
with $hard = 0.5$ gave a deviation of 4.0\AA, which is still acceptable and only
when the parameter values were dropped as low as $hard = 0.5$, $soft = 0.01$ was the
5\AA\ 'threshold' exceed.

contained in transparent tubes: red = \AH, green = \Bs s and cyan = loops.  Residues in these
tubes are restrained to lie at the surface but only weakly for loops.   Thin lines connect
residues in \A\ and \B\ elements that are hydrogen-bonded.   In some of the tests, an additional 
link was added between the two loop segments that connect domains (horizontal line lower-front).

C-terminal \AH\ which contributed most to the overall 5\AA\ root mean square deviation.
This level was set as a target threshold to remain below. 
\end{footnotesize}
}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{8+8 domain collision:\\}

The same approach was applied to the larger 8-domain construct over a series of collisions 
ranging from a glancing blow to almost head-on collision.  The tests were repeated
both with the domains in a continuous chain and as separate (unbonded) subunits.
The repulsion of the highest level sphere was set initially low with $hard=0.2, soft=0.1$
and the two $hard$/$soft$ parameter combinations applied to the secondary structure and domain 
levels were tested.  (Table 1).

The mean RMSD over the domains before and after the collision seldom exceeded the (self-imposed)
threshold if 5\AA\ RMSD for both parameter combinations and, as would be expected, the deviations
were slightly reduced when the domains were treated as subunits.   However, some of the worst
distortions seen in the full (almost head-on) collisions had markedly elevated RMSD values, up to 8\AA.
Despite excluding the 5 residue amino and 5 residue carboxy terminal linking segments from the comparison
(which often must diverge in different directions), examination of these worst cases revealed that a
large component of the error often came from displacement of the un-tethered C-terminal \AH.
(Figure 2(b)).

To reduce this source of error, a link as added between the mid-points of the 5-residue N- and C-terminal
segments that connect domains.  However, this had little effect, and even led to a slight overall increase in RMS
deviations.   On visual examination the distortions appeared to remain associated with the terminal helix
which was still able to be markedly displaced despite the C-terminal tether but now this occurred more
at the expense of disrupting other neighbouring secondary structure elements.

To allow contact at the atomic level between the colliding objects,
it is desirable to limit the repulsion from the higher levels of the hierarchy.
With the $hard$:$soft$ parameter combinations used above of 20:10, 50:20, 50:20 for the protein, domain 
and secondary structure levels respectively (as a percentage of the atomic level), the colliding surfaces
were able to make contact but without serious deformation occurring.   These values were adopted for
all further simulations.

The RMSD values observed in the small chemotaxis-Y protein (PDB code: {\tt 3chy}) during the collision
of two 8-domain/subunit collisions are tabulated as the minimum, average and maximum values when each

severity were tested from a complete {\bf miss} through a glancing blow ({\bf clip}) to a {\bf half} face
collision and finally an almost head-on collision ({\bf full}).    The models were tested both as individual
{\bf subunit}s and as {\bf domains} linked in a Hilbert curve.   The 'loose' C-terminal \AH\ was either
tethered ({\bf link on}) or free ({\bf no link}).    Two parameter combinations were tested with the
{\bf hard:soft} repulsion ratio at both domain and secondary structure levels set to ($a$) 50:20 and ($b$) 
100:20, as a percentage of the unit weight at the atomic level.  The repulsion parameters for the

\paragraph{64+64 domain collision:\\}

The next larger complete Hilbert curve of protein domains comprises 64 domains (8256 residues)
and the interaction of two such objects approaches the computational limits of what can be run
on a laptop computer in real time (over a few minutes).   Nevertheless, a small number of test
were conducted with the highest level in the hierarchy consisting of a sphere of unlinked proteins,
each composed of 8 linked domains as employed above.    The $soft:hard$ parameter combination
for this level was again set to 10:5 (percent of atomic).

The mean domain start/final RMSD value after a half-face collision was 6.5\AA.  No inter-object
clashes were seen at the atomic level but a marked number of intra-object clashes built-up
during the collision.   It seemed likely that this higher than expected RMSD value 
was therefore a consequence of the speed of the collision giving insufficient time for the
'shock-wave' of compression to dissipate through the domains. (Figure 3)

The collision was then re-run in 'slow-motion' with a time-step slowed by a factor of 10.
(The collision that normally took a few minutes now took 30).  The mean RMSD then dropped to
the acceptable value of 5.3\AA\ but intra-body clashes were still prominent during the collision.
This was similar to the collision of the largest Hilbert cubes, with the intra-object
collisions absorbing the 'energy' of the crash.
